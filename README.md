# <DU Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I set out to create a coherent guide with short explanations of the different topics discussed in the pre-course work for DU's coding bootcamp.
 - I iterated slightly on the style set out for this project, replacing the electric blue with a calmer deep azure, and a subtler white for the background.
 - This page serves as a proof of concept for a first pass learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git workflows.
 - Any student looking at this site will see a barebones but functional introduction to their course.
 - I learned how to use JavaScript to influence Chrome console content as well as how to create a page from pure HTML, something I've never done before.

## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Credits](#credits)

## Installation

As this is a single webpage, no installation is required other than a web browser (Chrome, FireFox, Edge, Safari) and access to the internet.

## Usage

Users may review the material included in the pre-coursework by visiting this page. However, there are a couple of hidden surprises located in the console.

To open the console, right click anywhere on the page and ![click "inspect."](assets/images/scrnsht_4.png)

Note that the final line in the console reads !["Let's Study XXXX!"](assets/images/scrnsht_1.png) Your line may read HTML, CSS, Git, or JavaScript.

Refresh the page multiple times, and observe how the final line ![changes](assets/images/scrnsht_2.png) as you ![do so](assets/images/scrnsht_3), depending on the output of a random number generator.
